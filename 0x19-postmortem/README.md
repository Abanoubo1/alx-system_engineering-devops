# Post-Mortem: When NGINX Took a Coffee Break ☕️

## Issue Summary
- Duration: The outage interrupted our digital symphony from [Start Time with Timezone] to [End Time with Timezone].
- Impact: Our web service played hide and seek with 100% of our users, leaving them in a state of digital limbo.

## Root Cause
Our NGINX server decided it needed a coffee break, and in its caffeine-deprived stupor, it misconfigured itself. It's safe to say that NGINX should stick to serving web pages, not cappuccinos.

## Timeline
- Start Time: [Include the exact start time with timezone]
- Issue Detection: An engineer, our unsung hero, noticed our web service had gone rogue. It wasn't because of a monitoring alert or a customer's impassioned plea - NGINX simply didn't RSVP to the web party.

- Actions Taken: Initially, we suspected NGINX needed a makeover. We adjusted its hairstyle by tweaking the configuration file permissions and sprinkling a little 'nginx' magic. However, it seems NGINX wasn't into the new look and decided to stay in bed.

- Misleading Investigations: At first, we thought NGINX needed a fashion makeover. But alas, the issue ran deeper than a new outfit. We chased the red herring of config files but found no solutions there.

- Escalation: As the crisis escalated, it was time to bring in the experts. We called in the server operations team and our lead system administrator. Because when in trouble, we bring out the big guns.

- Resolution: We restored our web service by hitting the "Undo" button on NGINX's bad decisions. Reverting the config changes, restarting NGINX, and voilà, our web service was back in action!

## Root Cause and Resolution
- Root Cause Explanation: NGINX got a little too ambitious and decided it could moonlight as a barista. It changed its own configuration, leading to a web service that was as confused as we were when it decided to play the barista game.

- Resolution Explanation: To get our web service back on track, we hit "Ctrl+Z" on NGINX's barista aspirations. We undid the config changes, brought it back to reality, and hit the restart button to get it back on its web-serving duty.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- Improvements/Fixes:
  - Our first step: Review and document server configuration changes with the seriousness of a coffee connoisseur's journal.
  - We'll introduce a Change Management process with more testing than a barista's latte art practice.
  - We're installing a magical "NGINX Crystal Ball" for monitoring and alerting so we can foresee any future coffee cravings.
  - Periodic server configuration audits, because prevention is better than late-night espresso shots.
  - Staff training - we're making sure everyone knows that NGINX and barista aren't interchangeable job titles.

In the world of web servers and coffee, things can get a little crazy. Our NGINX server might've had a caffeine overdose, but we've learned our lesson. With a bit of humor and a lot of prevention, we're ready to brew the perfect web service again. Cheers to a more caffeinated, yet stable, future!
